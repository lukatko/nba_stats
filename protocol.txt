Self-assessment
---------------

Please leave only one of the four status codes for each task, followed by an optional note

I've changed my plan a little bit because I didn't know how I would assess how good a player really is and what combination
of good players is the best and I found a library called streamlit that is used nowadays for data science websites, so I 
wanted to give it a try.


Submitted files:

https://github.com/lukatko/nba_stats
The website is deployed here: https://lukatko-nba-stats-main-page-yx0xt2.streamlit.app/


Commands used with short comments:
----------------------------------------

I used pip to install some libraries.
Also used standard git commands to get it on github.
All the code used to create the website is in the files on github.

Results, discussion:
--------------------

Some of the observed results are described on the website. I also trained an xgboost model for classification. It is not optimal
because I didn't have a large dataset (I could get a bigger one, but I would have to aggregate more files, since I couldn't find
one that contained players from more seasons and I was running out of time). Next thing to note is that I didn't fine-tune the 
model as I was running out of time and I also just used 15% of data for my test set as I only had like 260 rows (I filtered
out players who didn't even play much).
